# asm_roller
Assembly-based Dice Roller

## About
I wanted to play around with more assmebly code after taking a class on it.  My solution was to create a simple program to use as an opportunity to do just that.

Basically, this was a trivial project to play around with assembly.

## Building
**step 1:** cd FLAVOR_OF_CHOICE/<br/>
**step 2:** make<br/>

- the C version will require gcc, make
- the x86 assembly will require nasm

## Running
./dice_roller <number of dice> <number of sides per die>

## Why no fancy, modern tools?
I wanted to play around with these older technologies a little bit to refresh my feel for the underlying low-level stuff.  The low-level concepts are necessary in order to make full-use of higher-level technologies correctly.  I have different plans for more modern projects.
