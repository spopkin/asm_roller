# asm_roller
Assembly-based Dice Roller

## About
I have been meaning to learn more assembly code.  This project is the ideal early project for that.  My plan is to create a dice-rolling program in C, then x86 Assembly, and ultimately for some form of risc-based microcontroller.  Then, I can proceed to take said microcontroller and add an interface to create a hardware roller for arbitrary dice rolling.  The reason for prototyping it on x86 is because I lack the microcontroller and supporting hardware I would otherwise use, and because it will be easier to start with an operating system initially.

## Disclaimer
It should not be my problem if something goes wrong.  I disclaim all liability.

## Planning
This software should be pretty trivial, so the plan is to:
1. Create a version in C
2. Make the associated x86 version(s).
3. Set up any microcontroller hardware I plan to put it on.
4. Make the non-x86 version(s).
5. Go play D&D with it.
